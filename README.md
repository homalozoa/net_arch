# Network Tools for Arch Linux

## Introduction

It is a toolset I create for very personal things. All tools are designed as AUR packages, and available to install with `makepkg`.

## Tool List

1. update_dns: It is a scripts package to update DNS configuration with API of GoDaddy. The script will check the change of local IPv6 address, and update the address with API every 12 hours.
